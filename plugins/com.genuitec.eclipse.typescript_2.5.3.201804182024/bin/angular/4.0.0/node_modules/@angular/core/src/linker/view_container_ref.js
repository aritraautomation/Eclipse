/**
 * Represents a container where one or more Views can be attached.
 *
 * The container can contain two kinds of Views. Host Views, created by instantiating a
 * {@link Component} via {@link #createComponent}, and Embedded Views, created by instantiating an
 * {@link TemplateRef Embedded Template} via {@link #createEmbeddedView}.
 *
 * The location of the View Container within the containing View is specified by the Anchor
 * `element`. Each View Container can have only one Anchor Element and each Anchor Element can only
 * have a single View Container.
 *
 * Root elements of Views attached to this container become siblings of the Anchor Element in
 * the Rendered View.
 *
 * To access a `ViewContainerRef` of an Element, you can either place a {@link Directive} injected
 * with `ViewContainerRef` on the Element, or you obtain it via a {@link ViewChild} query.
 * @stable
